    "In computations, a quantum computer uses qubits, also known as quantum bits, whereas classical computers use bits. A qubit can be both 1 & 0 or either of those, whereas a bit can be only 1 or 0 at a time. Classical computers used in day to day tasks may lack computational powers to solve complex problems where quantum computers come to the rescue. Adding more transistors to a classical computer only increases the computational power linearly, whereas more qubits linked together increases power exponentially."

    "<b>1. Superposition:</b> Unlike a bit, a qubit can exist in a combination of all possible states of 1 and 0 at the same time until it is finally observed. This capability of a qubit helps a quantum computer increase its computational power because a qubit can take all computational paths simultaneously. Researchers use microwave beams or lasers to achieve this."
